    	<p class="main__paragraph">The Ordinary is an evolving collection of treatments offering familiar, effective clinical technologies positioned to raise pricing and communication integrity in skincare. The brand was created to celebrate integrity in its most humble and true form. Its offering is pioneering, not in the familiar technologies it uses, but in its honesty and integrity. The Ordinary is born to disallow commodity to be disguised as ingenuity. The Ordinary is "Clinical formulations with integrity".

      <h3>How do I use multiple formulas in a regimen?</h3>
      <p>In general, water formulations should be applied before oil formulations and we recommend using a maximum of three serum formulations in a single regimen. We have developed a more comprehensive guide on choosing and using our formulations.</p>

			<br>
			

			<h3>Do you offer a refund policy?</h3>
      <p>Yes, we offer a 365-day full refund policy across all DECIEM brands including The Ordinary.</p>

			<br>
			

			<h3>Do you test on animals?</h3>
      <p>As required by the European Cosmetics Regulations, we only work with suppliers who do not perform animal testing. Since that regulation came into force, it has pushed cosmetic raw material suppliers to replace animal testing with available alternatives to support the safety of their ingredients. DECIEM and The Ordinary do not test on animals and do not ask others to do so. For this reason, none of our brands or products are sold in stores or conventional retailers in mainland China, since such sales require animal testing for registration purposes.</p>

			<h3>What is The Ordinary?</h3>
      <p>Please read about us in the About section by clicking <a href="about.html">here</a>.</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Why do you offer so many different formulations with Vitamin C?</h3>
      <p>Topical Vitamin C offers a wide array of benefits to the skin. However, many forms of Vitamin C and many more formulations of Vitamin C are available commercially with a potential to confuse the audience. We have developed a guide that offers guidance on the formulations of Vitamin C offered under The Ordinary range. It also offers education on Vitamin C itself and on the differences between formulations of Vitamin C at large</p>

      <br>

      <h3>Are your products safe to use?</h3>
      <p>All DECIEM products undergo a thorough safety assessment before hitting the market. Each ingredient is reviewed against current scientific literature and strict global regulations to ensure they are safe and compliant for topical application. Always follow the directions of use. If you have questions about any ingredient we use, please reach out to us via DECIEM.com/contact and our lab will provide a response.</p>
